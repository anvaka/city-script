# city-script

Collection of scripts that can be loaded into [city-roads](https://anvaka.github.io/city-roads/).

I'm working on adding more scripts, and you are more than welcome to contribute your ideas and scripts
here.

## Find Paths

Allows you to draw thousands of shortest paths in any city between two random points, or between
one fixed point and thousands random points.

If you have long distance loved ones you can make a perfect gift, drawing "all roads lead to you" city

[Read documentation here](FindPaths.md)

## Color by elevation

This script reads elevation data from MapBox and allows you to color roads based on their level above the sea.

## Roads orientation

This script renders a histogram of roads length-directions. You can click on bars to highlight matching roads:

## More scripts

I hope to add more scripts. If you have requests - please do not hesitate to open [issue here](https://github.com/anvaka/city-script/issues), or [ping me on twitter](https://twitter.com/anvaka).

If you are a software engineer and would like to build the scripts too - you are more than welcome to
explore the [source code](https://github.com/anvaka/city-script/blob/master/lib/findPaths.js).

I'm slowly updating documentation for the most major modules used by the city-roads, and if you don't
want to wait or need some ideas how to do `X` (where `X` is your own passion/idea) - please ping me. I love data
visualizations and would be glad to help.
